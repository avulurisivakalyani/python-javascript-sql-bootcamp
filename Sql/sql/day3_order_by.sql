-- Day 3 - SQL DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT

-- List unique marks
SELECT DISTINCT marks FROM students;

-- Order students by marks descending
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC;

-- Show top 3 students
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC
LIMIT 3;
Next Steps in VS Code
Save these files in their respective folders.

Stage, commit, and push:

powershell
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Day 3: Added Loops files for Python, JS, SQL"
git push origin main
âœ… After this, your Day 3 practice will be on GitHub.

I can prepare Day 4 (Functions) files next so you can continue your 10-day plan smoothly.

Do you want me to do that?
